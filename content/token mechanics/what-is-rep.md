In Kurate REP is a score that enumerates the “reputation” a Player has accumulated during gameplay. REP is earned through positive interactions (as defined by Kurate devs). REP is not public — your REP score is only visible to you, nor is it spendable. However the more REP a Player accumulates, the more they are able to do in Kurate.

REP also acts as spam prevention, and promotes positive action. REP must be staked when submitting a post, so the total REP one has limits the amount of posts one can submit at a time. Plus, a Player loses their staked REP or earn REP based on whether the community votes to Promote or Demote their submitted post.

**The mechanics of REP**

* Players must stake 5 REP when submitting a post to community curation (voting).
* A Player loses their staked REP if, by the end of the Cycle, the community votes to Demote their post.
* A Player receives their staked REP back and earns a 5 REP bonus if, by the end of the Cycle, the community votes to Promote their post.
* In case of a tie vote (or if the minimum vote threshold of 3 votes is not met), the Player receives their staked REP back, and the post is deleted.
* Voting Players earn 1 REP if they vote in the direction of the community (whether to Promote or Demote).
* The creator of a Persona sets the minimum total REP a Player must have to submit a post in that Persona. The higher the minimum REP, the better a Player must be to participate. Keep in mind, regardless of the minimum REP requirement, the staking requirement to submit a post is always 5 REP.
* Staked REP is always included in a Player’s total REP score for the purpose of determining whether or not they meet minimum REP requirements.
