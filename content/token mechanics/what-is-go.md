title: 'What is GO?'
order: 3

GO animates all actions in Kurate — it’s the cost of doing business. All Players are given 30 GO at the beginning of each Cycle. Every gameplay action a Player takes depletes their GO holdings. GO both limits spam in the ecosystem and promotes activity (capped amount of GO per Player per Cycle + use-it-or-lose-it).

**Go cost per action**:

* Vote on a submitted post: 1 GO
* Submit a post: 5 GO
* Publish a Persona: 10 GO

Players who do not have enough GO will not be able to take the above actions.

GO does not roll over, so any GO left over gets burned at the end of a Cycle. Concurrently, Players start fresh with 30 new GO as the new Cycle begins.
