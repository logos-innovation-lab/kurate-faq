A Player wishing to post content through a Persona, must stake 5 REP tokens as they submit the Post to Curation (voting).

If the community votes to Promote the post to the Persona's main page, at the end of the Cycle, the submitting Player receives their staked REP back, and they receive a 5 REP bonus. If the community votes to Demote the post (delete), the Player loses their staked REP. In the case of a tie or the minimum vote threshold is not met (3) the submitting Player receives their staked REP back (the post is deleted).
