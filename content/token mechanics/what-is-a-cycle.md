title: 'What is as Cycle?'
order: 0
---

In Kurate, gameplay is broken up into 8 hour time slots called “Cycles”. The beginning and end of a Cycle hold significance, and overall that the Cycle exists (and is finite), encourages Players to “act”.

**Significance of Cycles**:

* When a Post is submitted, it is immediately subject to Curation.
* Curation of a post (voting) lasts up to 1 Cycle. For posts submitted Mid-Cycle, Curation lasts the remainder of that Cycle.
* At the end of each cycle, votes are tallied. Posts voted to Promote graduate to the main Persona page. Demoted posts are deleted.
* GO is reset at the end of each Cycle. All GO unused during the Cycle is burned. 30 new GO is given to each Player.
* REP is allocated and re-calculated at the beginning of each Cycle
