In Kurate it is possible to Chat with a Player whose post was Promoted to a Persona’s main page. That way two anonymous Players may communicate with each other around a topic (the post) they’re both interested in.

**To begin a Chat**: Select a post, and use the Chat box at the bottom of the screen.

**To see Chats you're participating in or are invited to**: On the main page of kurate.eth, choose the "Chats" button at the top of the page.
