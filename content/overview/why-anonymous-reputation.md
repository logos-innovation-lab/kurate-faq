title: 'Why Anonymous Reputation?'
order: 4

Anonymous reputation allows for privacy with accountability. In Kurate Players anonymously post public content, but are subject to curation by the community. The Poster must stake reputation (REP) when they submit their post.

If the community decides their post is in-character, their post graduates to the Personaâ€™s main page. The Poster receives their staked REP back along with a 5 REP bonus. The higher the REP score, the more the Player may do in Kurate.

So Players may remain private, but are incentivized to post content their community deems appropriate.
