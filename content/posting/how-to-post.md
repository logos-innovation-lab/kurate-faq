Choose a Persona you’d like to Post through. At the top of the main Persona page, select “Submit Post” and follow the steps. Once your Post is submitted it is moved into the “pending” feed while it goes through community curation (voting). If the community votes to Promote your Post it will graduate to the Persona’s main page.

**To Post, a Player must stake 5 REP — if they don’t have enough they may earn REP through curation.**

If their post is Promoted, they receive their staked REP back and receive 5 bonus REP. If their Post is Demoted, their Post is deleted and they lose their staked REP.
