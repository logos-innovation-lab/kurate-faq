title: 'What happens once a Post is Curated?'
order: 4
---

All submitted Posts are subject to curtion by vote, which community members have until the end of the Cycle to cast. There are 3 possible outcomes:

**Promote**: If more community members vote to Promote, the Post graduates to the Persona's main page. The Posting Player receives their staked REP back, plus a 5 REP bonus.

**Demote**: If more community members vote to Demote, the Post is deleted. The Posting Player loses their 5 staked REP.

**Third state**: If the votes ends in a tie, or if the minimum vote total (3) is not reached, the Post is deleted. But the Poster receives their staked tokens back.
