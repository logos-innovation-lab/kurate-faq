A Post is a content container created by an anonymous Player, which may include text, images, or video. A Post is created within a Persona and submitted to the Persona's community for curation (voting).

The goal of the Posting Player is to create content that the community feels is “in character” of the Persona, and therefore is Promoted. Promoted content is the “voice” of the Persona. So, to create Promoted content is to Speak through the Persona.

Another way to look at it is: A Player posts **public content** while wearing the Persona like a mask, so their **identity remains private**.
