A Player's REP score enumerates their earned reputation. It signals a Player's ability to act in accordance to a community's social norms. In Kurate, a Persona develops a community of people interested in curating content around a specific topic or context. The community's curation sets that Persona's social norms.

**REP by Posting**: If a Player submits a Post in a Persona that the community finds appropriate (thus  Promoted), they will be rewarded with 5 REP tokens.
