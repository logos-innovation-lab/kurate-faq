**Anonymous Posting + public curation = anonymity with accountability.**

In  Kurate all Players are anonymous, so that means all Posts are submitted anonymously but posted publicly. But because each post goes through curation, the community has a say over whether or not the Post gets Promoted to the Persona's main page, or Demoted (deleted).

By Posting anonymously a Player is more free to be themselves, since perceptions about their content won't impact their identity. Thus, there's no need to fear professional or social repercussions. This leads to more authentic public discourse, with less self-censorship.
