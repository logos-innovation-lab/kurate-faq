In Kurate, a Persona is a group identity that allows anonymous community members to create and curate public content together. From an individual Player’s perspective wishing to create content, it’s like posting publicly while wearing the Persona as a mask.

How it works is, a Player chooses a Persona and submits a post. Before a post goes live, the community has the opportunity to vote on whether or not a post is “in character” of the Persona. If they vote yes, the post graduates to the Persona’s main page. If no, the post gets deleted. Thus communities can anonymously curate context-specific content together.

**Players earn reputation (REP) by participating in content creation and curation.**
