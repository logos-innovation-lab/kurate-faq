From an outward perspective, a Persona may look similar to individuals and groups posting on other social media. It’s a timeline of content often following a theme.

However, what’s drastically different is the internal mechanism that produces the public content. In Kurate, groups of anonymous people curate content together by voting on whether or not submitted posts are in the character of the Persona. Only posts deemed in-character (Promoted) make it to the public timeline.

Because all posts are subject to group curation, a Persona’s timeline and thus its character is constantly under development. The one exception is seed posts.

Prior to making a Persona public, the Persona creator writes 5 seed posts. Seed posts are not subject to curation, so they can be used by the creator to set the tone of the Persona.
