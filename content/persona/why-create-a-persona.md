One way of looking at a Persona is it’s a community of people interested in anonymously curating content around the same context or topic. For example, a travel-based Persona may attract a group of people curating interesting photos, stories, and products from places around the globe.

Launching a Persona is for someone who wants to create the context a community of people might gather around, and post through. It’s for someone who wishes to inspire a community to curate content in a context they’re interested in.
