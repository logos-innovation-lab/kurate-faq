title: 'What are Seed Posts'
order: 2
---

Before a Player is able to make a Persona public, they must create 5 “seed” posts. Seed posts are not subject to curation. Their purpose is to set the tone of the content a Player hopes will be curated through the Persona.

Once launched, no one (not even the creator) may control how the community will develop a Persona’s content, so seed posts are a great way to influence curation at launch.

After the seed posts are submitted, a Player may maske the Persona public.
