order: 5

During the Persona creation process, a Persona creator must choose a minimum REP amount. This refers to the minimum REP required for a Players to be able to post in that Persona.

Raising the minimum increasingly limits participants to more experienced Players.

A Persona creator may not choose a higher REP minimum than their personal total REP amount.

Keep in mind that no matter what minimum reputation level is chosen, the staking requirement to post remains 5 REP.
