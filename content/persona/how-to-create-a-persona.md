Any logged-in Player with sufficient GO (10 or more) and REP (at least 5) may create a Persona. Select “Create Persona” from the Persona List page to get started. Follow the steps through the creation flow. Once complete the Persona is saved as a draft.

Before the Persona can go public, the creator must submit 5 seed posts. Seed posts are not subject to curation. They can be used by the creator to set the tone of the Persona.
