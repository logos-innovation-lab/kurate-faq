Waku is a suite of privacy-preserving, peer-to-peer messaging protocols. It removes centralized third parties from messaging, enabling private, secure, censorship-free communication with no single point of failure.

Waku provides privacy-preserving capabilities, such as sender anonymity,metadata protection and unlinkability to personally identifiable information. It is designed for generalized messaging, enabling human-to-human, machine-to-machine or hybrid communication.

Waku runs everywhere â€” desktop, server, and resource-restricted devices, such as mobile devices and browsers.
