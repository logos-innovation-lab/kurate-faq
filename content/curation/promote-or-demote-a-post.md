Posts submitted in a Persona go through curation (community vote) to determine whether or not they will be sent to the Persona's main page.

To see pending posts, select 'Review pending' on a Persona's main page. The two options are to vote to Promote or Demote the Post.

**Promote**: This Post is in-character (appropriate) for the Persona. Posts voted to Promote graduate to the Persona's main page and the Posting Player receives 5 REP.

**Demote**: This Post is not in character (appropriate) for the Persona. Posts voted to Demote are deleted and the Posting Player loses their 5 staked REP.
