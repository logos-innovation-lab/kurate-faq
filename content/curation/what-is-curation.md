Kurate allows anonymous groups of people to curate content together, around a theme or context. When a post is submitted in a Persona, it goes onto a pending page where the community may vote on whether or not it’s appropriate for the Persona.

**If the community votes “yes” (Promote), the post graduates to the Persona’s main page. If the community votes “no” (Demote) the post gets deleted.**

Through curation, a Persona’s main page is crafted by the community, since only Promoted Posts will arrive there. This curation mechanism is what provides accountability in an environment where all the Players are anonymous.
