There are two ways to earn REP in Kurate, posting and curating. This is how a Player earns REP through curation:

When a Post is submitted in a Persona, it goes onto a pending page where the community may vote on whether or not it's appropriate for the Persona (Curation). 

Voters earn REP when they vote in-line with the community, regardless of which direction the vote ends up. For example, if a majority of voters vote to Demote, each Demote voter earns 1 REP. All Players who voted to Promote earn no REP.
